# Optimization-of-IoT-Routing-Protocols

**Problem Statement:**

In the domain of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, ensuring optimal data routing is essential to maximize resource efficiency, minimize latency, and conserve energy. Current IoT routing protocols often struggle to adapt to the dynamic nature of IoT devices and the diverse data generated. To address this challenge, our project introduces a methodology that combines Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling (MLFQ) for packet prioritization with Dijkstra's algorithm for path selection. This approach is designed to elevate IoT network performance by proficiently managing data packet prioritization and routing.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a smart city implementation featuring a multitude of IoT sensors and devices responsible for gathering data on various parameters such as traffic flow, air quality, and energy consumption. These sensors continuously generate data packets with differing levels of importance and urgency.

- **Low-Priority Packets:** These packets could contain routine sensor readings with low urgency, such as temperature data. For instance, a temperature sensor sends periodic updates every 15 minutes.

- **Medium-Priority Packets:** Some packets, such as real-time traffic updates from smart traffic lights or vehicle sensors, possess moderate urgency.

- **High-Priority Packets:** Critical data, like emergency alerts or immediate traffic congestion reports, demand swift delivery. For instance, a sensor detecting a sudden increase in air pollution requires an immediate response.

However, the existing IoT routing protocol faces challenges in effectively managing this diverse data traffic. Low-priority packets might congest the network, delaying the transmission of high-priority data, potentially resulting in critical information not reaching authorities in a timely manner.

The proposed methodology, combining MLFQ for packet prioritization and Dijkstra's algorithm for routing, aims to resolve these issues. By categorizing packets appropriately and selecting the most efficient routing paths, this project seeks to ensure that high-priority data, such as emergency alerts, takes precedence and reaches its destination promptly, while routine data experiences minimal delays.

**Significance of the Problem:**

Efficient IoT data routing is not only essential for smart cities but also for various other IoT applications, including industrial automation, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. The suggested methodology has the potential to enhance the reliability, responsiveness, and overall performance of IoT networks across diverse domains, ultimately leading to more effective and dependable IoT systems.
